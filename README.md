# ðŸ“š Docr

> Docr is a barebones and dead simple static site generator in Go. It converts Markdown content to HTML using the goldmark library, applies a template, and generates static HTML files according to your configuration and templates.

## Usage

### Installing Docr

Built binaries are automatically published to Github Releases, so you do not need to install the Go toolkit and build Docr yourself. Simply obtain
the latest release from the [releases tab]() and run the binary.

You will also need the contents of the [templates/] directory, which you can obtain from the same source as they are uploaded there.
